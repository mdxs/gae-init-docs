We assume that you already know how to run the Google App Engine applications from a command line, but if not you should refer to the [documentation](https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/python/gettingstartedpython27/helloworld). Execute in your terminal `gulp` from the root directory

```bash
$ cd /path/to/phonebook
$ npm install
$ gulp
```

If everything went smoothly you can test the application by visiting the following URL in your web browser:

[http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)

Feel free to spend some time by clicking on the different menus. As a first change within the app you can sign in as administrator and after visiting the [http://localhost:3000/admin/config/](http://localhost:3000/admin/config/) change the **Brand Name** from **gae-init** to **Phonebook** (or to anything else you like). By doing that you should see on the top left corner the new name for your application.
