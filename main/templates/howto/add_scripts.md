All the custom scripts are located under [`main/static/src/script/`](https://github.com/gae-init/gae-init/tree/master/main/static/src/script) directory and you can update them if needed. Most of the time though it is much better to create more files for better structure of the project.

Create new files (`*.coffee` or `*.js`) under `main/static/src/script/` and your web app should automatically refresh to load the updated files.
