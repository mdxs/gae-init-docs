Test the application on your local machine.

1. Start a console and change into the `hello` sample app directory:

   ```
   cd hello
   ```

2. Start the sample app web server with the following command:

   ```
   gulp
   ```

   The web server is now running, listening for requests on port 8080.

3. Visit [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) in your web browser to see the app in action.

For more information about the supported commands run `gulp help`.
