You can leave the web server running while you develop your application. The web server watches for changes in your source files and reloads them if necessary. Try for example:

1. Leave the web server running (in a console window).

2. Go to and keep [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) loaded in your browser.

3. Edit `main/templates/welcome.html` and change `Hello, world!` to something else.

4. When you save, you should see the change automatically reloading in the browser.
